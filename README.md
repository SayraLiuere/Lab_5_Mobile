## Main Problems

The merged project has several technical issues that prevent it from running properly:

Missing dependencies - The pubspec.yaml doesn't include the required packages for Firebase, image handling, and advanced UI features
Empty asset directories - All image and icon files are missing, which will cause runtime crashes
Incomplete code implementation - Many core files and directories are empty
No Firebase setup - Missing configuration files and project setup
Basic template code - The main.dart still uses the default Flutter counter app

The project structure is there, but the actual implementation and resources are incomplete, making it non-functional as submitted.
